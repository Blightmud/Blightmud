# Blightmud  : A mud client for the terminal

Blightmud has been a passion project of mine for some time. A big user of the old
but great tinyfugue I always wanted to create my own similar mud client. Even
though I don't play much muds these days.

## Contributing
All contributions are welcome. Check out [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Side notes
This is my first rust project that has actually grown a bit. Some things might look silly but thanks to rust they should still be safe. Anywho. If you find some antipattern where you have a better idea I'm more then happy to se the PR and learn some more rustier ways.
