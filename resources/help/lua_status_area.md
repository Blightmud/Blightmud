# Status area methods

These methods allow you to control the height and content in the status area.

##

***blight.status_height(height)***
Sets the status area height to the specified number. The first and last row will always be rendered as bars. But you can still print to these bars

- `height`  The height to set (1 <= height <= 5)

***blight.status_line(index, line)***
Prints a line to the status area. If you print to a 'bar line' the content will be integrated into the bar. The "(more)" info shown when scrolling will always
be allowed to occupy space before your custom line when applicable.

- `index`   The line to print to (0 based), if it's greater then the height of your area it will always default to last line. If it's less than 0 it will default to 0.
- `line`    The line you want to print
