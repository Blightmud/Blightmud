# Scripting

The default scripting language for Blightmud is Lua.

You can manually load your script files with the `/load` command or you can 
auto-load them as configuration scripts. 
See `/help config_scripts` for more information on auto-loading scripts.

Alternatively, you can execute Lua directly with the `/lua` command.

In Lua you have access to various modules providing an api against blightmuds
core to interact with your game. You can read the documentation for each module
by typing `/help <module>`.
