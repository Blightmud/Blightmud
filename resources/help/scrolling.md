# Scrolling

You can scroll the output history of your game using keys (default
`PgUp`/`PgDn`) or mouse (if you enabled the setting).

If your current output area is longer then 20 lines then blightmud will split
the window into two, the upper will show you the output history that you are
scrolling and the lower will show you the live output from your mud.
